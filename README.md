# Burger Builder Application
I made this application while completing a React course on Udemy. The course was a deep dive into React and covered many topics including Redux, React Router, hooks, networking, testing, and authentication. This application allows a user to sign up/in, build a burger order, place an order, and view order history.

## Stack
* Multi-page React app managed with React Router
* Redux for state management
* Firebase database and hosting
* Networking through Axios
